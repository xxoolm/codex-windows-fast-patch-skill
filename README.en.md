# Codex Windows Fast Patch Skill

Language: [中文](README.md) | English

This is the public version of the `codex-windows-fast-patch` skill. It helps Agent-Skills-capable agents repair common Windows Codex Desktop features that break after Desktop updates.

## Features

Use this skill when Windows Codex Desktop updates cause issues like these:

- Repair Fast Mode / Priority Mode when it is hidden, disabled, or does not actually take effect.
- Repair the UI language resetting to English after restart.
- Repair plugin entries, plugin install buttons, and plugin marketplace lists.
- Repair the in-app browser, browser pane, Chrome, or browser_use when they are unavailable.
- Repair Computer Use / computer control / Any App when it is unavailable.
- Repair Computer Use errors such as `native pipe unavailable`, `missing-helper-path`, broken plugin cache, or broken helper paths.
- Repair native phone remote control under a third-party API login state when the entry is hidden, the QR code keeps spinning, setup redirects to ChatGPT login, Allow fails, or the phone says the Codex version is expired.
- Repair Goal entries, settings entries, or feature buttons that disappear or become disabled after updates.
- Repair Desktop new-chat/thread-start failures caused by `dynamicTools` schema drift, including `missing field inputSchema` when the CLI smoke path still works.
- Restore local conversations in the official sidebar after switching `model_provider` / API config when the local history data still exists.
- Repair broken local plugin marketplace config or `codex plugin list` errors.
- Optionally back up and restore local Codex config, skills, marketplaces, and related state.
- Automatically update this skill to the latest version before each repair attempt.

## Platform Support

This skill supports Windows only.

It depends on the Windows Store / MSIX package layout, PowerShell, `Get-AppxPackage`, `makeappx.exe`, `signtool.exe`, Windows user environment variables, and Windows Computer Use helper paths.

Do not run it on macOS. A macOS version needs a separate workflow for the Codex `.app` bundle, ASAR extraction and repacking, `codesign` or quarantine handling, shell scripts, and macOS-specific Computer Use availability gates.

## Install

Clone this repository, open PowerShell in the repository root, then copy only the skill files:

```powershell
$source = (Get-Location).ProviderPath
if (-not (Test-Path -LiteralPath (Join-Path $source 'SKILL.md'))) {
  throw 'Run this command from the codex-windows-fast-patch-skill repository root.'
}

$dest = Join-Path $env:USERPROFILE '.codex\skills\codex-windows-fast-patch'
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path $dest | Out-Null

Copy-Item -Force -LiteralPath (Join-Path $source 'SKILL.md') -Destination $dest
Copy-Item -Recurse -Force -LiteralPath (Join-Path $source 'agents') -Destination $dest
Copy-Item -Recurse -Force -LiteralPath (Join-Path $source 'scripts') -Destination $dest
Copy-Item -Recurse -Force -LiteralPath (Join-Path $source 'references') -Destination $dest
Copy-Item -Recurse -Force -LiteralPath (Join-Path $source 'assets') -Destination $dest
```

After installing into Codex, restart Codex so it reloads skill metadata.

## Usage

After installation, ask an agent that supports Agent Skills to use the `codex-windows-fast-patch` workflow for the Codex Desktop issue on the current machine.

This skill supports self-updating: before each substantive use, the agent first tries to check GitHub and sync the latest version, so you do not need to repeatedly return to GitHub and pull updates manually. This keeps the local skill as close as possible to the latest known workflow for newly discovered issues; if the network is unavailable, GitHub cannot be reached, or the download fails, that update step is skipped and the agent should continue with the currently installed local version.

The scripts are reference implementations and operational templates, not a one-command fix that is guaranteed to work on every machine. A real run should first read `SKILL.md`, inspect the current Codex installation method, MSIX package path, ASAR contents, signing tools, plugin directories, and Computer Use file state, then decide whether to execute, adapt, or only borrow steps from the scripts.

## Which Runner To Use

Some repairs reinstall Codex Desktop. During reinstall, the current Codex Desktop process is closed. Do not ask the same Codex Desktop session to reinstall itself unless you are fine with the session being interrupted.

The current Codex Desktop session can usually repair these without another agent:

- Computer Use says the plugin is unavailable, shows `native pipe unavailable` or `missing-helper-path`, or breaks again after restart.
- Chrome / browser_use helper paths, plugin cache, or native-host files are broken.
- Plugin marketplace config is broken, or `codex plugin list` fails because of marketplace manifests.
- A local marketplace is missing `.agents\plugins\marketplace.json`.
- Old local conversations disappear after switching `model_provider` / API config, but `sessions`, `archived_sessions`, or `state_5.sqlite` still contain the data. Use provider history sync first; this does not require an MSIX reinstall.
- You only need backup/restore work or the optional custom model instructions setup.
- Phone remote control already pairs, but phone-created turns hit the wrong model API endpoint. Treat this as a post-pairing configuration diagnosis: inspect the actual request URL and current config before changing anything.

Use another agent, external PowerShell, the Codex extension inside VS Code/Antigravity, or any environment that will not be closed by the Codex Desktop reinstall for these:

- Fast Mode / Priority Mode is hidden or not taking effect.
- The UI language resets to English after restart.
- Plugin entries, install buttons, Goal entries, or Computer Control `Any App` are greyed out or missing.
- The in-app browser, browser pane, Chrome, or browser_use is hidden or disabled by Desktop-side gates.
- Phone remote control is hidden, the QR keeps spinning, setup redirects to ChatGPT login, Allow fails, or the phone reports an expired Codex version.
- Any repair that needs a full repatch, MSIX repack, Developer-signed package install, `app.asar` replacement, or `resources\codex.exe` replacement.

Simple rule: if the repair stops, uninstalls, reinstalls, or relaunches Codex Desktop, run it from another agent or external PowerShell. If it only changes local config, plugin cache, marketplace files, backups, or verification, the current Codex Desktop session can usually handle it.

Example request: `Use the codex-windows-fast-patch skill to inspect and repair Codex Desktop Fast Mode, language/locale, Chrome browser_use, plugin marketplace, and Computer Use availability on this Windows machine.`

Phone remote-control example request: `Use the codex-windows-fast-patch skill to repair Windows Codex Desktop phone remote control while preserving my third-party API provider and current conversation history.`

Expected verification after a full run:

- The patch log includes `fast-mode UI patch result`, `locale i18n patch result`, and `browser-use gate patch result`, each as `patched` or `already-patched`.
- Fast Mode wire verification captures `service_tier=priority` in Codex Desktop's `/v1/responses` request.
- Desktop logs show `browser_use_availability_resolved` with `available=true` and `reason=local-patched` when browser use is part of the repair.
- If Chrome control is required, `codex plugin list` shows `chrome@openai-bundled` as `installed, enabled`, the native messaging host manifest points to existing files, and a smoke test can read a controlled tab title such as `Example Domain`.
- If phone remote control is repaired, Connections shows the phone setup path, QR appears, phone scan does not report an expired Codex environment, native logs show remote-control WebSocket ping/pong/ack, and phone-created turns reach Desktop.
- If conversation visibility is repaired, `sync-codex-provider-history.ps1` shows App/legacy SQLite stores and readable rollouts aligned to the current `model_provider`, logs `config.toml sha256 unchanged`, official Desktop conversations reappear, and no empty project groups are introduced.

## Backup Management

Repair scripts automatically back up the previous `config.toml` into `.codex\backups\config\` before writing it. To manually back up or migrate important local Codex state, use the standalone backup manager:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\skills\codex-windows-fast-patch\scripts\manage-codex-backups.ps1" -Action Backup
```

List existing backups:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\skills\codex-windows-fast-patch\scripts\manage-codex-backups.ps1" -Action List
```

Restore from a backup:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\skills\codex-windows-fast-patch\scripts\manage-codex-backups.ps1" -Action Restore -BackupPath "<backup path>"
```

By default, the backup includes custom skills, marketplaces, `config.toml`, extracted `mcp_servers.json`, and `chrome-native-hosts.json`, while excluding easy-to-grow directories such as `.git`, `node_modules`, build outputs, and virtual environments. Use `-IncludeDependencyDirs` only when an exact offline dependency copy is needed; plugin cache and `.tmp\bundled-marketplaces` can also be large, so include them only when needed with `-IncludePluginCache` or `-IncludeTmpBundledMarketplaces`.

# Codex Windows Fast Patch Skill

Language: [中文](README.md) | English

This is the public version of the `codex-windows-fast-patch` skill. It guides agents through restoring local Codex Desktop patches and feature gates after Windows Store upgrades.

## Features

- Reapply the Windows MSIX patch after Codex Desktop upgrades.
- Verify that Fast Mode requests really send `service_tier=priority`.
- Register and repair local plugin marketplace configuration.
- Repair local plugin marketplace manifest layout.
- Refresh Windows Computer Use compatibility files.
- Unlock the Computer Control `Any App` gate when the UI reports organization or region unavailability.

## Platform Support

This skill supports Windows only.

It depends on the Windows Store / MSIX package layout, PowerShell, `Get-AppxPackage`, `makeappx.exe`, `signtool.exe`, Windows user environment variables, and Windows Computer Use helper paths.

Do not run it on macOS. A macOS version needs a separate workflow for the Codex `.app` bundle, ASAR extraction and repacking, `codesign` or quarantine handling, shell scripts, and macOS-specific Computer Use availability gates.

## Files

- `SKILL.md`: Agent skill entrypoint.
- `agents/openai.yaml`: Agent configuration.
- `scripts/repatch-codex-windows.ps1`: Workflow reference script.
- `scripts/patch_codex_fast_mode_windows_msix.ps1`: MSIX / ASAR patch reference implementation.
- `scripts/install-computer-use-local.ps1`: Windows Computer Use local compatibility reference implementation.

## Install

Clone this repository, open PowerShell in the repository root, then copy only the skill files:

```powershell
$source = (Get-Location).ProviderPath
if (-not (Test-Path -LiteralPath (Join-Path $source 'SKILL.md'))) {
  throw 'Run this command from the codex-windows-fast-patch-skill repository root.'
}

$dest = Join-Path $env:USERPROFILE '.codex\skills\codex-windows-fast-patch'
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path $dest | Out-Null

Copy-Item -Force -LiteralPath (Join-Path $source 'SKILL.md') -Destination $dest
Copy-Item -Recurse -Force -LiteralPath (Join-Path $source 'agents') -Destination $dest
Copy-Item -Recurse -Force -LiteralPath (Join-Path $source 'scripts') -Destination $dest
```

After installing into Codex, restart Codex so it reloads skill metadata.

## Usage

After installation, ask an agent that supports Agent Skills to use the `codex-windows-fast-patch` workflow for the Codex Desktop issue on the current machine.

The scripts are reference implementations and operational templates, not a one-command fix that is guaranteed to work on every machine. A real run should first read `SKILL.md`, inspect the current Codex installation method, MSIX package path, ASAR contents, signing tools, plugin directories, and Computer Use file state, then decide whether to execute, adapt, or only borrow steps from the scripts.

Example request: `Use the codex-windows-fast-patch skill to inspect and repair Codex Desktop Fast Mode, plugin marketplace, and Computer Use availability on this Windows machine.`

## CPA Upstream Configuration

If Codex requests go through CPA upstream, changing the local request to `service_tier=priority` is not enough by itself. Add a CPA override rule for the models that handle Codex requests and force the parameter `service_tier` to string value `priority`, so the upstream actually uses the Fast / Priority path.

The model names in the image are examples. Use the real Codex-facing model names configured in CPA.
